Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) provide a method for inter-process communication (IPC) on the same host machine. They are represented as special file system nodes and offer lower latency and higher throughput compared to traditional TCP/IP sockets, making them ideal for local communication between services.

## Benefits of Using Unix Domain Sockets

* **Performance:** UDS bypasses the network stack, resulting in faster data transfer.
* **Security:** Access can be controlled via file system permissions.
* **Simplicity:** No need to manage IP addresses or ports for local communication.

## Setting Up Unix Domain Sockets in Kito

```typescript
import { server } from 'kitojs';
const app = server();

app.get('/', ({ res }) => {
    res.send('Hello via Unix Domain Socket!');
});

app.listen({ unixSocket: './kito.sock' }, () => {
    console.log('Server listening on Unix Domain Socket ./kito.sock');
});
```

In this example, the Kito server listens on a Unix Domain Socket located at `./kito.sock`. 

**Note:** Ensure that the file path is accessible and has the appropriate permissions for the server to create and bind to the socket.

## Connecting to a Unix Domain Socket

To connect to a Kito server using a Unix Domain Socket, you can use tools like `curl` or create a client in your application.

```bash
curl --unix-socket ./kito.sock http://localhost/
```

This command sends a request to the Kito server via the specified Unix Domain Socket.
